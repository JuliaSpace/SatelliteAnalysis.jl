Given the Earth's gravitational potential, all the low Earth orbits (LEO) suffer from
perturbations in their elements. The right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) is one of
the elements that see a secular perturbation. Hence, we can use this effect to design
orbits that the RAAN time derivative matches that of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. In
this case, the orbit plane keeps its geometry almost constant regarding the Sun vector.
Hence, the apparent local time of the ascending or descending node (LTAN and LTDN) will also
be almost invariable, as shown in the following figure:

```@raw html
<div align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/sun_sync_orbit_plane.png" alt="Orbit Plane in Sun-Synchronous Orbits" width="100%"/>
</div>
```

In fact, if the Earth was a perfect sphere, no secular perturbation would be seen in RAAN.
Hence, the LTAN would have a variation of 24 hours in a year.

Considering only terms up to ``J_2``, which is the dominant effect, the RAAN time derivative
is:

```math
\frac{d\Omega}{dt} = -\frac{2}{3} J_2 \left(\frac{R_0}{p_0}\right)^2 \bar{n} \cos i_0\ ,
```

where ``R_0`` is the Earth's Equatorial radius, ``i_0`` is the orbit inclination, ``p_0 =
a_0 (1 - e_0^2)``, ``a_0`` is the orbit semi-major axis, and ``e_0`` is the orbit
eccentricity, and ``\bar{n}`` is the perturbed mean-motion, given by:

```math
\bar{n} = n_0 \left[1 + \frac{3}{4} J_2 \left(\frac{R_0}{p_0}\right)^2 \sqrt{1 - e_0^2} \left(2 - 3\sin^2 i_0\right)\right]\ ,
```

where ``n_0 = \sqrt{\mu / a^3}``, and ``\mu`` is the Earth's standard gravitational
parameter.

!!! note

    Formally, all quantities on the right-hand side of those equations must be the mean
    elements instead of the initial ones. However, we are considering only the secular
    perturbations caused by the ``J_2`` term. Thus, the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and
    inclination do not suffer from secular effects.

Finally, we can design a Sun-syncrhonous orbit by selecting the semi-major axis and
inclination that leads to:

```math
\frac{d\Omega}{dt} = 0.9856473598947981^\circ / s\ .
```

## Designing Sun-Synchronous Orbits from Angular Velocity

The satellite orbital angular velocity ``\omega_o`` is:

```math
\omega_{o}(a_0, i_0) = \frac{dM}{dt} + \frac{d\omega}{dt}\ ,
```

where ``M`` is the mean anomaly, and ``\omega`` is the argument of perigee. Considering only
the secular effects caused by the ``J_2`` term, one gets:

```math
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{dM}{dt} &= \bar{n}\ , \\
  \frac{d\omega}{dt} &= \frac{3}{4} J_2 \left(\frac{R_0}{p_0}\right)^2 \bar{n} \left(4 - 5\sin^2 i_0\right)\ .
\end{aligned}
```

Thus, given a desired angular velocity ``n_d``, we can find the semi-major axis and
inclination that leads to a Sun-synchronous orbit by numerically solving the system:

```math
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{d\Omega}{dt}(a_0, i_0) &= 0.9856473598947981^\circ / s\ , \\
  \bar{n}(a_0, i_0) &= n_d\ .
\end{aligned}
```

The function:

```julia
sun_sync_orbit_from_angular_velocity(angvel::T1, e::T2 = 0; kwargs...) where {T1 <: Number, T2 <: Number} -> T, T, Bool
```

computes the Sun-synchronous orbit semi-major axis [m] and inclination [rad] given the
angular velocity `angvel` [rad / s] and the orbit eccentricity `e` [ ]. If the latter is
omitted, the orbit is considered circular, _i.e._, `e = 0`.

The algorithm here considers only the perturbation terms up to ``J_2``.

!!! note
    Internally, this function uses the precision obtained by promoting `T1` and `T2` to a
    float-pointing number `T`.

The following keywords are available:

- `max_iterations::Number`: Maximum number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson method.
    (**Default** = 3)
- `no_warnings::Bool`: If `true`, no warnings will be printed.
    (**Default** = `false`)
- `tolerance::Union{Nothing, NTuple{2, Number}}`: Residue tolerances to verify if the
    numerical method has converged. If it is `nothing`, `(√eps(T), √eps(T))` will be used,
    where `T` is the internal type for the computations. Notice that the residue function
    `f₁` unit is [deg / day], whereas the `f₂` unit is [deg / min].
    (**Default** = 1e-18)
- `m0::Number`: Standard gravitational parameter for Earth [m³ / s²].
    (**Default** = `GM_EARTH`)
- `J2::Number`: J₂ perturbation term.
    (**Default** = `EGM_2008_J2`)
- `R0::Number`: Earth's equatorial radius [m].
    (**Default** = `EARTH_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS`)

It returns:

- `T`: Semi-major axis [m].
- `T`: Inclination [rad].
- `Bool`: `true` if the Newton-Raphson algorithm converged, or `false` otherwise.

### Example

Let's say we want to compute the Sun-synchronous orbit for a mission that must perform
exactly 14 orbits per day:

```@repl sun_sync
n_d = 14 * (2π / 86400)
a, i, converged = sun_sync_orbit_from_angular_velocity(n_d)
a / 1000
rad2deg(i)
```

## Designing Sun-Synchronous Orbits from Semi-Major Axis

Given a desired semi-major axis ``a_d``, we can compute the inclination that turns the orbit
into a Sun-synchronous one by solving numerically:

```math
\frac{d\Omega}{dt}(a_d, i_0) = 0.9856473598947981^\circ / s\ .
```

The function:

```julia
sun_sync_orbit_inclination(a::T1, e::T2 = 0; kwargs...) where {T1 <: Number, T2 <: Number} -> T, Bool
```

computes the inclination [rad] of the Sun-synchronous orbit with semi-major axis `a` [m] and
the eccentricity `e` [ ]. If the latter is omitted, the orbit is considered circular, i.e.,
`e = 0`.

The algorithm here considers only the perturbation terms up to ``J_2``.

!!! note
    Internally, this function uses the precision obtained by promoting `T1` and `T2` to a
    float-pointing number `T`.

The following keywords are available:

- `max_iterations::Number`: Maximum number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson method.
    (**Default** = 30)
- `tolerance::Union{Nothing, Number}`: Residue tolerance to verify if the numerical method
    has converged. If it is `nothing`, `√eps(T)` will be used, where `T` is the internal
    type for the computations. Notice that the residue unit is [deg / day].
    (**Default** = nothing)
- `m0::Number`: Standard gravitational parameter for Earth [m³ / s²].
    (**Default** = `GM_EARTH`)
- `J2::Number`: J₂ perturbation term.
    (**Default** = `EGM_2008_J2`)
- `R0::Number`: Earth's equatorial radius [m].
    (**Default** = `EARTH_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS`)

It returns:

- `T`: Inclination [rad] of the Sun-synchronous orbit with semi-major axis `a` and
    eccentricity `e`.
- `Bool`: `true` if the Newton-Raphson algorithm converged, or `false` otherwise.

### Example

Let's find the inclination that turns an orbit with semi-major axis 6819 km and eccentricity
0.0015 into a Sun-synchronous one:

```@repl sun_sync
i, converged = sun_sync_orbit_inclination(6819e3, 0.0015)
rad2deg(i)
```

## Designing Sun-Synchronous Orbits from Inclination


Given a desired inclination ``i_d``, we can compute the semi-major axis that turns the orbit
into a Sun-synchronous one by solving numerically:

```math
\frac{d\Omega}{dt}(a_0, i_d) = 0.9856473598947981^\circ / s\ .
```

The function:

```julia
sun_sync_orbit_semi_major_axis(i::T1, e::T2 = 0; kwargs...) where {T1 <: Number, T2 <: Number} -> T, Bool

```

compute the semi-major axis [m] of the Sun-synchronous orbit with inclination `i` [rad] and
the eccentricity `e` [ ]. If the latter is omitted, the orbit is considered circular, i.e.,
`e = 0`.

The algorithm here considers only the perturbation terms up to ``J_2``.

!!! note
    Internally, this function uses the precision obtained by promoting `T1` and `T2` to a
    float-pointing number `T`.

The following keywords are available:

- `max_iterations::Number`: Maximum number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson method.
    (**Default** = 30)
- `tolerance::Union{Nothing, Number}`: Residue tolerance to verify if the numerical method
    has converged. If it is `nothing`, `√eps(T)` will be used, where `T` is the internal
    type for the computations. Notice that the residue unit is [deg / day].
    (**Default** = nothing)
- `m0::Number`: Standard gravitational parameter for Earth [m³ / s²].
    (**Default** = `GM_EARTH`)
- `J2::Number`: J₂ perturbation term.
    (**Default** = `EGM_2008_J2`)
- `R0::Number`: Earth's equatorial radius [m].
    (**Default** = `EARTH_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS`)

It returns:

- `T`: Semi-major axis [m] of the Sun-synchronous orbit with inclination `i` and
    eccentricity `e`.
- `Bool`: `true` if the Newton-Raphson algorithm converged, or `false` otherwise.

### Example

Let's find the semi-major axis that turns an orbit with inclination axis 98.190° and
eccentricity 0.001987 into a Sun-synchronous one:

```@repl sun_sync
a, converged = sun_sync_orbit_semi_major_axis(98.190 |> deg2rad, 0.001987)
a / 1000
```

## Designing Sun-Synchronous, Ground-Repeating Orbits

The most common type of a Sun-synchronous orbit is a ground-repeating one. In this case, we
have a Sun-synchronous orbit, as mentioned before, whose ground track repeats after a finite
number of (solar) days. The ground-repeating condition happens if the satellite performs a
rational number of orbits per solar day:

```math
R_d = I + \frac{N}{D}\ ,
```

where ``R_d`` is the number of revolutions per day, and ``I, N, D \in \mathbb{N}``. If the
greatest common divisor of ``N`` and ``D`` is one, the ground track of such an orbit repeats
after ``NI + D`` revolutions, or ``D`` solar days.

If an orbit has ``R_d`` revolutions per solar day, we can compute its angular velocity as
follows:

```math
\omega_o = R_d \frac{2\pi}{86400}\ .
```

Hence, we can design a Sun-synchronous, ground-repeating orbit by numerically solving the
system:

```math
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{d\Omega}{dt}(a_0, i_0) &= 0.9856473598947981^\circ / s\ , \\
  \bar{n}(a_0, i_0) &= R_d \frac{2\pi}{86400}\ ,
\end{aligned}
```

using the same method we described in the Section [Designing Sun-Synchronous Orbits from
Angular Velocity](@ref).

The function:

```julia
design_sun_sync_ground_repeating_orbit(minimum_repetition::Int, maximum_repetition::Int; kwargs...) -> DataFrame
```

lists all the Sun synchronous, ground repeating orbits in which their repetition period is
in the interval `[minimum_repetition, maximum_repetition]` days.

This function returns a `DataFrame` with the following columns:

- `semi_major_axis`: Orbit semi-major axis.
- `altitude`: Orbit altitude above the Equator `(a - R0)`.
- `inclination`: Orbit inclination.
- `period`: Orbital period.
- `rev_per_days`: If the keyword `pretify_rev_per_days` is `false`, this column contains
    `Tuple`s with the integer and rational parts of the number of revolutions per day.
    Otherwise, it contains a string with a prety representation of the number of revolutions
    per day.
- `adjacent_gt_distance`: Distance between two adjacent ground tracks at Equator.
- `adjacent_gt_angle`: Angle between two adjacent ground tracks at Equator measured from the
    satellite position.

!!! note

    The units of those columns depends on the keywords.

The following keywords are available:

- `angle_unit::Symbol`: Unit for all the angles in the output `DataFrame`.  It can be `:deg`
    for degrees or `:rad` for radians.
    (**Default**: `:deg`)
- `distance_unit::Symbol`: The unit for all the distances in the output `DataFrame`. It can
    be `:m` for meters or `:km` for kilometers.
    (**Default**: `:km`)
- `eccentricity::Number`: Orbit eccentricity.
    (**Default**: 0)
- `int_rev_per_day::Tuple`: `Tuple` with the integer parts of the number of revolutions per
    day to be analyzed.
    (**Default** = `(13, 14, 15, 16, 17)`)
- `pretity_rev_per_days::Bool`: If `true`, the column with the revolutions per day will be
    conveted to a string with a pretty representation of this information.
    (**Default**: `true`)
- `maximum_altitude::Union{Nothing, Number}`: Maximum altitude [m] of the orbits in the
    output `DataFrame`. If it is `nothing`, the algorithm will not apply a higher limit to
    the orbital altitude.
    (**Default** = `nothing`)
- `minimum_altitude::Union{Nothing, Number}`: Minimum altitude [m] of the orbits in the
    output `DataFrame`. If it is `nothing`, the algorithm will not apply a lower limit to
    the orbital altitude.
    (**Default** = `nothing`)
- `time_unit::Symbol`: Unit for all the time values in the output `DataFrame`.  It can be
    `:s` for seconds, `:m` for minutes, or `:h` for hours.
    (**Default** = `:h`)
- `m0::Number`: Standard gravitational parameter for Earth [m³ / s²].
    (**Default** = `GM_EARTH`)
- `J2::Number`: J₂ perturbation term.
    (**Default** = `EGM_2008_J2`)
- `R0::Number`: Earth's equatorial radius [m].
    (**Default** = `EARTH_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS`)
- `we::Number`: Earth's angular speed [rad / s].
    (**Default**: `EARTH_ANGULAR_SPEED`)

### Example

Let's find all the possible orbits between 650km and 800km that repeat the ground track in,
at most, 5 days:

```@repl sun_sync
df = design_sun_sync_ground_repeating_orbit(
    1,
    5;
    minimum_altitude = 650e3,
    maximum_altitude = 800e3
)
show(df; crop = :none)
```

!!! info

    The designer can use the fields `adjacent_gt_distance` and `adjacent_gt_angle` to check
    whether the mission payload can operate correctly in the orbit. For example, in orbit
    \#4, the payload swath of a remote sensing satellite with a camera must be higher than
    543.811 km. Otherwise, there will be gaps in the images.
